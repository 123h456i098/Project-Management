Instructions:
You are the penguin, your goal is to move from the start (yellow pad) to the end (green pad), using the movement buttons or WASD or arrow keys.
Watch out for monsters, questions, and traps!
Move through the countries, and at the end of each, test your knowledge with a quiz to move on.
Good luck!
